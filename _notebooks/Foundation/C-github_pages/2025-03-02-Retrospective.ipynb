    "## 5 Things I Did This Trimester (as a deployment admin)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1.) Static API Data\n",
    "    - Coordinated team efforts to establish and test API endpoints prior to full deployment, and verified that they worked using Postman\n",
    "- 2.) Dynamic Backend Data\n",
    "    - Helped troubleshoot database requests and enhance performance efficiency.\n",
    "- 3.) CRUD Operations\n",
    "    - Developed and integrated essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to improve data handling.\n",
    "    - Verified operations through Postman\n",
    "- 4.) Deploment Assistant Admin\n",
    "    - Tasked with organizing deployment into a burndown list that helped to guide my teammates towards success\n",
    "- 5.) Collaboration\n",
    "    - Developed collaborative relationships with peers from my period and other CSP classes in order to succeed"
