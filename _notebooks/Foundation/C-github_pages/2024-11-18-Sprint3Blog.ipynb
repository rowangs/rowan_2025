    "### what I learned:\n",
    "- I learned that collaboration is key to success in this class, because when i didn't know something I was able to ask my teammates/sister if they knew what the question entailed. I also learned the value of common sense, because alot of the questions were just that. Also, I learned that there was a lot of stats. \n",
