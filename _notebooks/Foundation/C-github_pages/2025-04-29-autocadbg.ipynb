    "As a practical extension of this research, I developed a **full-stack mini CAD application** using web technologies. The goal was to simulate basic CAD drawing tools‚Äîlike line, rectangle, circle, and squiggle‚Äîinside a browser, while connecting to a custom backend that saves and loads shapes per \"board\" (like a tab system).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî® Tools Used:\n",
    "- **Frontend**:  \n",
    "  - HTML5 Canvas for drawing  \n",
    "  - JavaScript for interactivity  \n",
    "  - CSS for layout  \n",
    "  - GitHub Pages for deployment  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend**:  \n",
    "  - Node.js + Express.js  \n",
    "  - REST API with endpoints for saving, deleting, and retrieving shape data  \n",
    "  - Hosted on [Render](https://render.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Features Implemented:\n",
    "- Drawing tools: line, rectangle, circle, squiggle, eraser  \n",
    "- Stroke color and brush size selection  \n",
    "- Undo and redo with backend state tracking  \n",
    "- Multi-tab canvas boards (separate drawing sessions)  \n",

    "### üìé Technologies in Action:\n",
    "This project shows how frontend drawing logic (canvas paths and mouse events) integrates with backend data persistence through RESTful API calls. State management is handled in JavaScript with undo/redo stacks per board, and each drawing is stored as a structured object in the backend, using an in-memory database.\n",
