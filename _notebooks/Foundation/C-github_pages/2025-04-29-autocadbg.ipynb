    "\n",
    "AutoCAD is a powerful CAD software by Autodesk, widely used in architecture. While most architectural tasks are performed through its interface, coding and scripting can drastically improve efficiency and customize functionality.\n",

    "### 1. **AutoLISP**\n",
    "- A version of the LISP language built specifically for AutoCAD.\n",
    "- Ideal for automating repetitive drafting tasks.\n",
    "- Common in architectural use for:\n",
    "  - Automating floor plan layout\n",
    "  - Inserting common elements (doors, windows)\n",
    "  - Calculating room areas or wall lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Visual LISP**\n",
    "- A development environment for writing and debugging AutoLISP.\n",
    "- Offers a GUI to simplify writing scripts.\n",
    "- Often used by architectural drafters to build custom functions faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **DCL (Dialog Control Language)**\n",
    "- Used alongside AutoLISP to create dialog boxes.\n",
    "- Helpful for architectural scripts needing user input (e.g., choosing room types or materials).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **.NET API (C# / VB.NET)**\n",
    "- Gives full access to AutoCAD‚Äôs object model.\n",
    "- Supports C# and VB.NET languages.\n",
    "- Used for:\n",
    "  - Custom plugins for architectural workflows\n",
    "  - Drawing validation tools (e.g., ADA compliance)\n",
    "  - Advanced automation and data extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **ObjectARX (C++)**\n",
    "- The most advanced and low-level API.\n",
    "- Written in C++ for performance-heavy customizations.\n",
    "- Often used in commercial-grade architectural add-ons.\n",
    "- Not beginner-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Python + Dynamo (for Revit, Related to AutoCAD Workflows)**\n",
    "- AutoCAD does not natively support Python.\n",
    "- Python is used heavily in **Dynamo**, a visual scripting tool in Revit.\n",
    "- Relevant for parametric design workflows or interoperability between Revit and AutoCAD.\n",
