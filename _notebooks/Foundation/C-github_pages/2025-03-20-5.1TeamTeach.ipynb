    "    - One harmful effect of technology in general is that it can lead to decreased face-to-face communication and weakened social skills. As people rely more on texting, emailing, or using devices, they often miss out on the emotional depth and connection that comes with in-person conversations. This can make it harder for individuals—especially younger generations—to develop strong interpersonal relationships and empathy. Over time, this lack of real-life interaction can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation. While technology offers convenience and efficiency, its impact on human connection can be deeply damaging."
